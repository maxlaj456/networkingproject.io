# Lab Plan

# Objectives
- Make devices to reach the internet
- Firewall rules should drop everything except ICMP traffic and SSH between networks
- All devices should get all necessary configuration from DHCP with no manual configuration
- All configuration and services should work after reboot with no manual intervention

# Tools 
- VirtualBox
- DHCP server
- NAT

# Expected outcome
Being able to reach the internet with the devices. Configure the firewall to only allow ICMP traffic and SSH. Every configuration and service should work after reboot. DHCP should automatically deliver all the necessary configuration to the devices.
