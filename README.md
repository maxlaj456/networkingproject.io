# Networking Lab

# Overview
A lab giving a insight on how I built and made a network between routers and devices work. 

# Goal
I will have 2 routers and 2 devices, one device for each router. There are several goals with this lab. Make it possible for the devices to reach the internet and to reach each other. Firewall rules should only allow ICMP traffic and SSH to go between the networks, everything else should be dropped. Each devices should get all necessary network configuration from DHCP with no manual configuration. All configruation and services should work after reboot without manual intervention.
